# React Crash Course

This repository contains my work while following the [React Crash Course](https://youtu.be/LDB4uaJ87e0?si=9TW_Hgmyzg7wtHxt) tutorial. The project is built using React and Vite, providing a minimal setup to get React working with Vite's Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of React and Vite, including setting up a development environment, creating components, managing state, and using hooks.

Currently, two official plugins are used:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) which uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) which uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh.
